# Artifactory in Swarm example

This directory contains an example for setting up Artifactory running in a Docker Swarm cluster.
In this example Artifactory Pro runs on one leader, meaning three images will run on the leader:
**docker.bintray.io/jfrog/artifactory-pro, docker.bintray.io/jfrog/postgres, docker.bintray.io/jfrog/nginx-artifactory-pro**

**This example applies only for Linux machines and was tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with Docker version 17.03.1-ce, build c6d412e**

## Docker Swarm

A swarm is a cluster of one or more Docker Engines running in swarm mode.
See details in the official [Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) documentation.

## Artifactory Pro with PostgreSQL and Nginx for Docker registry support

```bash
$ sudo ../docker-compose/prepareHostEnv.sh -t pro -c
$ sudo docker swarm init
$ docker stack deploy -c artifactory-pro.yml artifactory
```
